# vibe-code                                             
                                                          
  A terminal-based AI coding assistant that makes safe,   
  iterative code changes using                            
  Large Language Models (Claude/OpenAI). Never apply edits
   blindly—vibe-code uses                                 
  isolated filesystems and human approval workflows to    
  keep you in control.                                    
                                                          
  **Key Features:**                                       
  - 🤖 Natural language code requests (e.g., "Add type    
  hints to this function")                                
  - 🔒 Safe sandboxed editing with AgentFS—changes never  
  touch your real files until approved                    
  - 👀 Unified diff preview—see exactly what will change  
  before committing                                       
  - ⚡ Interactive approval workflow (approve/reject/edit 
  options)
